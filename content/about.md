# About
I'm a former longtime US public servant and current digital services guy working on the practical side of digital government â€” helping public agencies modernize services, improve systems, and navigate the space where policy meets implementation. Most of my career has been in and around the federal government, with a focus on product strategy, user experience, and service delivery.

This site is a place to work through ideas in writing. Those ideas tend to be about technology, policy, culture, and public institutions, but sometimes they're just about random things I think are neat. If you think something is neat too, you can email me about it.

You can also find me on:

## Professional stuff
I've had kind of a Chili's Sampler Platter of jobs. I've been a public sector management consultant, comms director for a global democracy nonprofit, founding member of the CFPB tech team (<span alt="RIP">ðŸª¦</span>), digital diplomacy & analytics leader at the State Department, and even worked in the factory that puts together your Scholastic book orders. But most relevant here, I held increasingly senior/executive roles in the federal government tech/product/digital services space.

Right now I'm leading federal civilian accounts at [Ad Hoc](https://adhoc.team/about/), a digital services firm. I lead teams working with NASA, Library of Congress, IRS, FDIC, and others to deliver great tech and try to make government work a little better.

The common thread is a belief that technology can actually enhance democracy by improving services and strengthening the relationship between people and their government.{% footnoteref "bio-footnote", "Except the Scholastic book order thing. That was just a fun gig." %}{% endfootnoteref %} Basically I'm a democracy and government nerd who sort of stumbled into technology as an entry point for that and never left.
## Personal stuff
I'm originally from [Queens](https://media4.giphy.com/media/3orieKAP0XTW7oZlks/giphy.gif?cid=9b38fe91gtz8bhl35wtbddia64nr6m2xohg8iy77do80tbjq), NY. Today I live in Alexandria, VA with my wife (a current public servant) and daughter. I love music, travel, historical nonfiction books/podcasts, running/lifting, and being a connoisseur of northern VA's incredible international restaurant scene. I _love_ a good spreadsheet.

I am [very very minorly internet famous as an email marketing guru](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E2%80%9Cmunz%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cdelete%20most%20of%20it%E2%80%9D&udm=14) thanks to a random tweet from like 2010.{% footnoteref "email-footnote", "Believe me, I find this as strange as you do." %}{% endfootnoteref %}

I'm a kidney donor, and my daughter is a kidney transplant recipient. [You can be a kidney donor too!](https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/becoming-living-donor) It's a pretty great deal: you can literally save a life, and all you have to do is get some tests and have a small routine surgery. Please please please AMA about any and all aspects of this, whether you're thinking of donating or just curious. I am happy to be your kidney donation guy.

Thanks for reading.
