# About


I'm a former longtime US public servant.


Iâ€™ve had kind of a Chiliâ€™s Sampler Platter of roles. Iâ€™ve been a public sector management consultant, comms director for a global democracy nonprofit, founding member of the CFPB tech team (ðŸª¦), digital diplomacy & analytics leader at the State Department, and even worked in the factory that puts together your Scholastic book orders. But most relevant here, I held increasingly senior/executive roles in the federal government tech/product/digital services space. 

Right now I'm leading federal civilian accounts at Ad Hoc, a digital services firm. I get to lead teams working with NASA, Library of Congress, IRS, FDIC, and others to do great work and accomplish culture change through delivery excellence.

Fundamentally Iâ€™m a democracy and government nerd who sort of stumbled into technology as an entry point for that, and never left. The common thread is, {% footnoteref "scholastic-footnote", "Except the Scholastic book order thing. That was just a fun gig." %}everything{% endfootnoteref %} Iâ€™ve done in my career has been a test of the proposition that technology can actually enhance democracy by improving services and strengthening the relationship between people and their government.

I'm originally from Queens, NY. Today I live in Alexandria, VA with my wife (a current public servant) and daughter. I love music, travel, historical nonfiction books/podcasts, running (though going through more of a _lift heavy_ phase at the moment), and being a connoisseur of northern VAâ€™s incredible international restaurant scene. You can find my hot takes here and my nonsense here. I love a good spreadsheet.

Iâ€™m a kidney donor, and my daughter is a kidney transplant recipient. You can be a donor too! Itâ€™s a pretty great deal: you can literally save a life, and all you have to do is get some tests and have a small routine surgery. Please please please AMA about any and all aspects of this, whether youâ€™re thinking of donating or just curious. I am happy to be your kidney donation guy.

Pleased to be here and really excited to get to know yâ€™all! Donâ€™t hesitate to DM/LinkedIn/whatever me if I can be helpful or you just wanna chat. In these unprecedented times we all gotta stick together.




I work on the practical side of digital government â€” helping public agencies modernize services, improve systems, and navigate the space where policy meets implementation. Most of my career has been in and around the federal government, with a focus on product strategy, user experience, and service delivery.

This blog is a place to work through ideas in writing. Some posts are structured and deliberate; others are more exploratory. Topics tend to center on technology, policy, and public institutions, but may drift elsewhere from time to time.

Thanks for reading.
