If you're one of the many cable-cutters out there who live on Netflix/Prime/whatever, you've probably noticed the [creeping return of ads](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2025/05/15/netflix-goes-all-ads-content-and-cowboys-inside-its-third-upfront). And [*more* ads](https://www.adweek.com/media/amazon-doubles-prime-video-ad-load/)! And [different *kinds* of ads](https://www.theverge.com/news/667042/netflix-ad-supported-tier-94-million-users-upfront-2025)! This isn't just a commercial play: FAST services, short for free ad-supported streaming TV, are [booming](https://www.soundandvision.com/content/fast-times-rise-free-ad-supported-television).

Why are increasing numbers of consumers not only *tolerating* more ads but *affirmatively seeking out channels with ads even when they have worse content*? It seems pretty clear that the answer is just plain **fatigue**. Whether it's TV or streaming music, people are just fucking *tired* of [scrolling endlessly through menus](https://www.usertesting.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/lost-stream-survey-finds-americans-waste-nearly-five-days-year-just) and being funneled by algorithms into whatever's trending ("trending" here increasingly being code for *we invested a lot of money in making our technology company become a movie studio so for the love of god please watch this, my kid needs braces*) just to find some entertainment. 

Streaming has shifted us all into a world where finding something to watch or listen to both requires a lot of navigation and leads you into a desert of safe, repetitive sameness. FAST channels let you just press a button and watch *something*, recreating the ease and homey magic of finding new stuff the way we (of a certain age) used to: by just flipping around the dial. No wonder people are willing to put up with a few ads.








|                          | **Low Unexpectedness (Sameness)**                                     | **High Unexpectedness (Surprise)**                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Effort Required** | **Navigation Grind**<br>High effort to find content, but the results feel repetitive and predictable.<br>Examples: Most Netflix browsing, Spotify algorithmic playlists that replay favorites. | **Discovery Desert**<br>High effort *and* high surprise, but rare or unappealing because it demands work for random results.<br>Examples: Deep, unfiltered searches with random results; obscure content hunts without guidance. |
| **Low Effort Required**  | **Comfort Zone**<br>Effort is low, but so is surprise—you find familiar, predictable content with minimal work.<br>Examples: Traditional TV reruns, curated “Top Hits” radio stations. | **Serendipitous Discovery**<br>The sweet spot—low effort with unexpected, delightful finds.<br>Examples: Flipping TV channels, traditional radio DJs, FAST channels (free ad-supported streaming). |



Because my [life is dope and I do dope shit](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExM2lmM3g4dXB3aXFrNGJoaGF5aXg1eXlzdWdlbWk0aDhxM3h0N3ByYyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/l41m3D8YTRNRn9YAg/giphy.gif), I've been thinking about whether we can apply these lessons to digital public services.




So, what if government digital services took a page from this? Right now, they’re mostly built like Netflix or Spotify — users have to show up knowing what they want and where to find it. You have to navigate. Fine. But what’s the alternative? What’s the government’s version of flipping through channels? Just serving random pages? What if you could flip through the government just to see what’s on?

You see this in music too — TV and radio vs. Netflix and Spotify. There’s no opportunity to find something weird or “drive hands-off” — you have to _navigate_ the experience.

Can this mean anything for public digital services? In a way, we architect digital services more like the Netflix and Spotify model — you have to show up knowing what you want and where it is. You have to navigate. OK, fine, but what’s the alternative? What is the “flipping through channels” version of a government service or website? Just serving people random pages?

Here’s the thing: what if you could flip through the government just to see what’s on?

As service designers, we tend to focus on getting people where they want to go as quickly as possible. Reduce clicks! Top tasks! But just like Netflix, that ignores the very fat middle of the funnel — people who probably think they might want something from this agency, or heard a friend mention it, but don’t totally know what it is or does, or how to tell if it’s even the right place.

This came up when I was at CFPB. We would test forms, content, or services that scored very high, but then tanked on net promoter score — because even if an individual page or form is easy to navigate, there was the underlying question: “What even is this agency? Are they trustworthy? Are they the right place?” Trust is the first problem. VA knows this and tracks it. If people don’t really understand who you are, why you exist, and what you do, how easy your form is to navigate becomes pretty immaterial.

This is where AI can make things interesting. It’s tempting to think about all the ways AI can get people where they want to go faster, but AI also turns out to be pretty great at what you might call _intentional whimsy_ — collecting content in ways you’d never think of but that align pretty well with even a very vague prompt. I’ve been experimenting with this a lot in music — I love Apple Music, but its discovery features are comically bad. “Create Station” is like that old joke where you buy a blender on Amazon and it recommends eight more blenders you might like. “For You” playlists are a mess of navigation and reversion to the popular mean. So a little while back, I made a shortcut that uses ChatGPT to generate a playlist based on any input you give it — a seed song, a mood, a location, a vegetable, whatever — and drops that into Apple Music. It feels magical, and the reason it does is that it’s the first time since digital music went mainstream that I’ve had that same feeling of aimless, whimsical browsing and discovery that I get from flipping channels. I sort of know what I’m getting because I gave it a starting point, but I didn’t have to find or curate the music — there’s no _navigating._

Is there a way we can use AI to give this feeling about public services? Could we make an onboarding experience on, say, SSA.gov that asks people why they’re there and what they’re wondering about, and quickly curates relevant facts and images that people can “flip through” — almost like a Pinterest board of that agency. Not a form, not an “about” page, nor a list of tasks, but the thing humans instinctively want when they first set foot in any new place, digital or physical — a sense of the vibes.

This may feel kind of silly or nonsensical, but how many people show up at the digital doorstep of a federal agency and just walk away — instead of applying for the benefits they’re entitled to — because they can’t “flip around” and get a sense of the vibes? [insert stats about how many people each year are eligible for benefits but don’t apply] We can help them, and we could even make it fun.
